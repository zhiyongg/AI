Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\n2. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper.\n3. Season the lamb chops generously with the herb mixture.\n4. Place the lamb chops on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n5. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked to your desired doneness.\n6. Let the lamb chops rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* For a more flavorful chop, marinate the lamb in the herb mixture for at least 30 minutes before roasting.\n* To check for doneness, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the chop. The internal temperature should be 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for rare, 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium-rare, or 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium.\n* Lamb chops can also be cooked on the grill. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and cook the chops for 3-4 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired doneness.\n* Serve the lamb chops with your favorite sides, such as mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a green salad."]
